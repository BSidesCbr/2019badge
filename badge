instability -
  * removed pullup on reset
  * removed diode 
  * internal clock
  * works with ext clock, but maybe 16mhz is too much
  * if can't get working on internal clock (ideal) then switch to 8mhz
screen
  * one backlight LED permanently on, other off
  * can't seem to control via GPIO? switch pins?
  * can't bring up screen yet with u8g2
  * potentially because vout (gnd via capacitor) and osc (vcc) are not connected
rf
  * tbc
